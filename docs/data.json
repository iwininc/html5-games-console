For example.\n<pre>\n{\n  \"name\": \"Test Bed\",\n  \"code\": \"testbed\",\n  \"advertBehavior\": {\n    \"type\":\"specific_levels\",\n    \"levels\":[1,3,5,7]\n  }\n}\n</pre>\nDetails are..\n<pre>\n\"name\": Game name that will be displayed in the title bar of the console\n\"code\": Unique game code that will be used when deployed on the iWin portal.  We will likely change this after you send it to us\n\"advertBehavior\": This allows us to define when and where to display ads as the user plays the game.  The example above is a sample but we do support other types.  See ads class for more information\n</pre>\n\ngame/Index.html\n---------------\n \n+ The game/index.html is served via an IFRAME that is dynamically created by the console, and all requests inside that IFRAME will be local to the game folder.\n+ Internally, the system uses easyXDM to message between the game and the console (as they live in separate frames), but these calls are obfuscated through functions in ../iconsole.js (relative to the game folder). Therefore, any game implementing the console should load the iconsole.js from the parent folder as a script, before making any messages to the console.\n+ As the game loads, it makes calls to the console to notify the console of it's progress. Typically this is done when pre-loading assets required for the game. This ensures that the game window stays hidden from the player until the game has fully loaded, and that the advert panel is visible until the game is ready to play.\n+ Once the game assets have been fully loaded, the game calls the console to tell it has loaded the game. The console will remove the panel that is hiding the game, and signals that the advert can be removed (after minimum advert duration has been reached).\nFor more information see the included example 'game'.\n\nBackend Server\n--------------\n+ The SDK will speak to a test server hosted by iWin for certain API calls.\n+ The test server URLs that we call are: \n - https://sl.iwin.com: Stage Logon Server\n - https://sc.iwin.com: Stage Chat Server\n+ In order for chatroom and database persistence of user progress functionality to work, you should use develop with a hostfile entry of local.games.iwin.com pointing to your local development environment. If you use a different hostname, login/chat will not work, however, your data will be stored as an anonymous user in the html5 local storage object. \n\nImproving Game Performance\n--------------------------\n+ Only load the required assets at startup and load level specific assets as they are needed.\n+ Think about using JPEGs rather than PNGs (if you can)\n+ Use compressed image file types\n+ Reduce the bit rate for audio files.\n+ When pre-compiling data structures, consider breaking the computation blocks into smaller chunks and use timed callbacks to step through these chunks. This will ensure that the console gains some of the CPU time to ensure it can update the UI accordingly, and ensure that the browser doesn't consider the process to have died because it hasn't completed the call in a timely manner",

            "description": "Phaser.IO Issues\n----------------\n\nWe have discovered an issue with Phaser.io/iWin's Console with respect to Mozilla Firefox, in that the Pre-loading state never gets called when a Phaser game is launched from the console. The reason for this, is that the game is initially in a hidden iframe, and only made visible once the iConsole has been notified the game has started to load. Phaser.io recommends using a pre-loading State [Phaser Example Basic](https://github.com/photonstorm/phaser/tree/master/resources/Project%20Templates/Basic), and therefore you should place the initial calls to iConsole in this state. However, the Phaser internal request to requestAnimationFrame never returns the callback, until the iFrame is visible. This is a Catch-22 situation. Phaser allows for you to force using setTimeOut instead, but this makes for less smooth animations. The solution is a small blend of both.\nEnsure that your configuration you pass to the Phaser.game sets forceSetTimeOut to true, and you should pass another variable postLoadForceSetTimeOut to false (or true if you only need setTimeOut), and add code into the preload function of your loading state, to reset the game's requestAnimationFrame back to the best available.\n<pre>\nwindow.Game = new Phaser.Game({\n  width: Config.appWidth,\n  height: Config.appHeight,\n  renderer:Phaser.CANVAS,\n  transparent:true,\n  antialias: true,\n  canvasID:\"canvas\"\n});\n</pre>\nBecomes...\n<pre>\nwindow.Game = new Phaser.Game({\n  width: Config.appWidth,\n  height: Config.appHeight,\n  renderer:Phaser.CANVAS,\n  transparent:true,\n  antialias: true,\n  canvasID:\"canvas\",\n  forceSetTimeOut: true,\n  postLoadForceSetTimeOut: false\n});\n</pre>\nAnd in the loading state.\n<pre>\nLoadingState: {\n  preload: function() {\n      Game.raf.stop();\n      if (Game.config && Game.config['postLoadForceSetTimeOut'])\n      {\n          Game.raf = new Phaser.RequestAnimationFrame(Game, Game.config['postLoadForceSetTimeOut']);\n      }\n      else\n      {\n          Game.raf = new Phaser.RequestAnimationFrame(Game, false);\n      }\n      Game.raf.start();\n</pre>\nYou can see here, we stop the existing phaser timer (Game.raf), and then use the new configuration to recreate the RequestAnimationFrame, which will either take the forced setTimeOut from the new configuration, or attempt to get the requestAnimationFrame (falling back to setTimeOut if it's not available). This ensures that the initial LoadingState can be ticked in to for all browsers (because the initial timer callbacks are done with setTimeOut, which always fire, regardless of whether the iframe is visible or not), but the timers then revert to the more efficient timers that the browsers support once we are in the correct state, and can start calling the iConsole code from the correct state.",
